lsb_release -a # Show system distribution information

Since CentOS 6.6 has default Python 2.6.6 installed and a lot of System-level applications depend on it. So we don't want to mess up with default Python interperator
Theano requirement: Python >= 2.6 or >= 3.3
Lasagne requirement: Python >= 2.7 or >= 3.4

We could either choose 2.7 or 3.4. Thanks to my colleagues in Vision Group, we already have CUDA 7.0 and cuDNN 4 installed, this will save us a lot of time to configure the system

Due to some compile problem with liblapack, when I tried to import numpy into Python 2.7, there is always some error with liblapack.so, I choose to go with Python 3.4

cd /some/folder/
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.4/Python-3.4.4.tgz
cd Python-3.4.4
./configure --enable-shared \
            --prefix=/usr/local \
            LDFLAGS="-Wl,--rpath=/usr/local/lib"
# This configure is very important
# --enable-shared will enable Theano to create some shared library with Python, otherwise you will get import error with Theano
# LDFLAGS will point to libpython's correct path
make altinstall
# Important!! Install Python 3.4 without changing default Python
# If you made some mistake, make clean to delete all files
pip3.4 install --user numpy
pip3.4 install --user scipy
pip3.4 install --user --upgrade https://github.com/Theano/Theano/archive/master.zip
pip3.4 install --user --upgrade https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/archive/master.zip
# --user will install libraries in your home directory, without interfere with others 
Done!

vim ~/.theanorc to configure your theano
Example:
[global]
floatX = float32
device = gpu

Check your GPU with Theano

import theano
print(theano.sandbox.cuda.device_properties(0))
# Information about your GPU


from theano.sandbox.cuda.dnn import dnn_available as d
print(d() or d.msg)
# Expect True, means you have proper cuDNN installed
